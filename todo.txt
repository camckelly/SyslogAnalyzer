Syslog Analyzer To Do
=======================

Vision:
======
A light-weight, syslog count/analyzer, with filters.

Summer 2019:
===========
Granted, some of the counting could be done by piping some grep output to the "wc -l" command, but that won't filter out a time slice, like "exclude all Sundays".

Some TODO's can be found in the source code.

Other ideas include:
+Capability to filter out records.

+GUI user interface with FLTK library (also light-weight), including pie charts.

+Locale / language support.

+A testing folder: test date-time conversion reliability, ...other tests??
