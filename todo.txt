# Syslog Analyzer To Do

# Vision:
A light-weight, syslog count/analyzer, with filters.

# TODO
Granted, some of the counting could be done by piping some grep output to the "wc -l" command, but that won't filter out a time slice, like "exclude all Sundays".

SysLogTimeSeries.h is not finished, and is not used yet. It is intended to be used to convert string-dates in the log to a calendar-type, which we could then be used for advanced date filtering, like "Exclude Sunday's".

Another program that filters the records, which would then be saved to a new text file for further analysis.
This would be another program because you don't want to cram too much into one command-line utility.

GUI user interface with FLTK library (also light-weight), including pie charts.

Locale / language support.

A testing folder: test date-time conversion reliability, ...other tests??

Save single-records for further analysis.

A Windows Event Log version.
